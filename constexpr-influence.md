# constexpr influence on compile and run-time

1. What is the constexpr
2. What might be done with constexpr

## Test description

Test is a primenumber generator

## Compile-time calculation

1. How log take compile time
2. Which asembly we have as an outcome
3. How fast is runtime

## The same on run-time

1. How log take compile time
2. Which asembly we have as an outcome
